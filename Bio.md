- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ivo-PV00!
- 👀 I’m currently studying Chemistry in Lisbon, Portugal and doing an internship in Stockholm, Sweden.
- 🌱 I’m currently using LaTex as a very efficient way to make my thesis and work on documents and future posters. My interests align with exploring platforms like this one to help with daily life, as well as using programming languages like Python and C++ to create programs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to use some of the great skills on this platfrom to help me, and when needed, help others!
- 📫 How to reach me? By email: ivo.vilela2000@gmail.com; on Linkedin: ivo-pires-vilela; or Instagram, if you prefer: ivo_vilela_.
